A repository for the paper "Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition Based on Efficient CNNs in the Wild"

Efficient CNNs for traffic sign recognition

## Include:
### Traffic sign detector
  
### Traffic sign classifer
  
### Localization refinment
  
We show our work as three separate steps which are not difficult to be integrated into a complete pipeline.
